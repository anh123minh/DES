<h1><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>
	This page provides a brief introduction to discrete-event simulation,
	an overview of the simulation constructs as implemented in React.NET,
	and then proceeds to an example simulation program.  The example
	program simulates a barber shop and demonstrates some, but definitely
	not all, of the capabilities of React.NET
</p>

<h1><a name="sim"></a>Discrete Event Simulation</h1>
<p>
	If you're reading this, you've probably got a good idea of what
	<em>discrete-event simulation</em> is all about.  However, just in
	case you don't, here is a very brief description.  See
	<a href="index.html#links">Links</a> for a list of other resources
	that provide more information.
</p>

<p>
	Simulation, in general, is an attempt to model some aspect of the real
	world and gather data about the modeled system.  It's often used when
	directly observing the real-world system is not possible because: (1) it
	doesn't exist yet; or (2) it would be too costly or dangerous to test in
	multiple configurations/scenarios.
</p>
<p>
	There are several common simulation methodologies for example
	<em>continuous</em>, <em>linear-programming</em>, and
	<em>discrete-event</em>.  Each has strengths that make it most useful
	for a particular problem domain.
</p>
<p>
	Continuous simulation describe systems using one or more mathematical
	equations or <em>models</em>.  These models might be used to help
	understand a system based on rules of physics or economics.
</p>
<p>
	Linear programming (and non-linear programming) are often used to
	solve optimization problems that involve several variables.  An
	example might be maximizing profit on several products based on
	user demand, production output, production cost, and sales price.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, discrete-event simulations are used to model systems
	composed of activities that take place at distinct moments in time.
	Often these activities include random elements and potentially complex
	interactions with other activities.  Discrete-event simulations
	are often applicable to modeling business and manufacturing
	processes.
</p>
<p>
	Discrete-event simulation is especially useful in understanding
	systems that have <em>demand vs. capacity</em> and <em>queuing</em>
	aspects.  For example, a bank experiences demand (customers
	need to see tellers), has a capacity (there are only so many tellers
	available to service customers), and uses queuing (customers wait in
	line until they can see a teller).
</p>

<h1><a name="concepts"></a>Basic Concepts</h1>

<p>
	The following subsections introduce some of the most fundamental classes and
	concepts used to build React.NET simulations.
</p>

<h2>The Simulation</h2>
<p>
	The <span class="classname">Simulation</span> serves as the container for 
	<span class="classname">Task</span> instances. It also contains the clock used to
	control the time.  Each <span class="classname">Task</span> maintains a reference
	to the <span class="classname">Simulation</span> under which it runs.  This link
	is called the <em>simulation context</em> and is available as the
	<code>Context</code> property.
</p>

<p>
	For simple models, a single <span class="classname">Simulation</span> is used.  For
	more complex models that might be executed many times (e.g. monte-carlo
	simulations), multiple <span class="classname">Simulation</span> instances can be
	run either sequentially or in parallel using multiple threads.
</p>

<h3>The Clock</h3>
<p>
	Each <span class="classname">Simulation</span> maintains a <em>clock</em>.  The clock is
	responsible for keeping the current simulation time.  The clock
	maintains the time as a <span class="classname">System.Int64</span> (a C#
	<span class="classname">long</span>). The unit of time represented by the clock is up to
	the programmer.  Because the clock maintains time in integer units, choosing a
	time unit is important because the clock cannot represent fractional units.  For
	example, in a simulation that requires sub-second accuracy, one time unit might
	represent a millisecond; therefore to schedule a <span class="classname">Task</span> to
	run two seconds in the future, the program would schedule it to run in 2,000 time
	units.
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>
	A <span class="classname">Task</span> is executed by a <span class="classname">Simulation</span>
	to carry out some action.  Often one or more <span class="classname">Task</span>s are used
	as part of a <span class="classname">Process</span> (see below). <span class="classname">Task</span>s
	can be scheduled to run at a particular simulation time or they can be passed to a
	<em>blocking object</em> such as a <span class="classname">Resource</span> or
	<span class="classname">BoundedBuffer</span> to be resumed when a particular condition is
	met during the course of a simulation run.
</p>
<p>
	The work to be carried out by a <span class="classname">Task</span> is defined by implementing
	the	<code>ExecuteTask</code> method.
</p>

<h2>Processes</h2>
<p>
	A <span class="classname">Process</span> consists of a series of <span class="classname">Task</span>s
	carried out over time.  A <span class="classname">Process</span> is, in fact, a type of
	<span class="classname">Task</span> that yields (or returns) other <span class="classname">Task</span>s
	to carry out certain functions.  Each <span class="classname">Task</span> that
	a <span class="classname">Process</span> returns acts somewhat like a subroutine of the
	<span class="classname">Process</span>.  The <span class="classname">Task</span> runs and eventually
	when the <span class="classname">Task</span> completes, the <span class="classname">Process</span> is
	resumed (or re-activated).
</p>
<p>
	<span class="classname">Process</span> classes use the .NET 2.0 feature called an
	<em>iterator</em> to yield <span class="classname">Task</span>s.  The iterator, an
	<span class="classname">IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt;</span> instance, is
	returned by the <code>GetProcessSteps()</code> method of the
	<span class="classname">Process</span> class.
</p>

<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
protected virtual IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt; GetProcessSteps();
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>GetProcessSteps()</code> may be overridden by a derived class to implement
process-specific behavior, or a <code>ProcessSteps</code> delegate may be passed
to the <span class="classname">Process</span> constructor to provide process-specific
behavior without deriving a new class.
</p>

<div class="annotation" style="
						background-color: #4A86B8">Note</div>
<div class="message">
	<p>
		For most simulations, it is preferable to implement
		Processes rather than Tasks.
		One should of course remember that the <span class="classname">Process</span> class is
		derived from the <span class="classname">Task</span> class.
	</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Blocking Objects</h2>
<p>
	A <em>blocking object</em> is an object that causes a <span class="classname">Task</span>
	or <span class="classname">Process</span> to suspend it execution until such time as a
	particular condition has been met.  React.NET includes the following blocking objects.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Resource</dt>
	<dd>
		Represents a collection or <em>pool</em> of items, people, etc. each of which can be
		used by one <span class="classname">Task</span> at a time.  To obtain exclusive use of a
		<em>resource item</em>, a <span class="classname">Task</span> must <em>acquire</em> the item.
		When finished using	the resource item, the owning <span class="classname">Task</span> must
		<em>release</em> the item back into the pool. If a resource item is not immediately
		available, the requesting <span class="classname">Task</span> is blocked until such time as
		an item becomes available.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Consumable</dt>
	<dd>
		Similar to a <span class="classname">Resource</span>, a <span class="classname">Consumable</span>
		contains consumable items that, once acquired by a <span class="classname">Task</span>,
		are never released back into the pool.  Consumables are essentially resources that
		are "used up" by the acquiring <span class="classname">Task</span>.  An example of a
		consumable is fuel.  The <span class="classname">Consumable</span> class is <b>not</b>
		derived from <span class="classname">Resource</span>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Condition</dt>
	<dd>
		A <span class="classname">Condition</span> acts as a true/false switch during the
		simulation run. If the <span class="classname">Condition</span> is false or <em>reset</em>,
		any <span class="classname">Task</span>s can block on the <span class="classname">Condition</span>.
		Once the <span class="classname">Condition</span> becomes true or <em>signalled</em>,
		blocked <span class="classname">Task</span>s are re-activated.  The programmer may chose
		to re-activate all blocked <span class="classname">Task</span>s or just a single
		<span class="classname">Task</span> when the <span class="classname">Condition</span> becomes
		signalled.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>BoundedBuffer</dt>
	<dd>
		A <span class="classname">BoundedBuffer</span> is a queue of finite size.  <em>Producer</em>
		tasks put items into the buffer and <em>consumer</em> tasks take items out of the
		buffer.  When the buffer is full, any producer tasks attempting to put an item into
		the buffer will be blocked.  When the buffer is empty, any consumer tasks attempting
		to get an item from the buffer will be blocked.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>
	It is also possible to add other blocking objects to the system.
</p>

<p>
	Blocking behavior is implemented by methods marked with the <code>BlockingMethod</code>
	attribute.  All blocking methods return a <span class="classname">Task</span> instance which
	contains the functionality to property interact with the blocking object.  The
	<span class="classname">Task</span> which called the blocking method blocks on the returned
	<span class="classname">Task</span> not on the blocking object itself.  A typical blocking
	method looks something like what's shown below.
</p>

<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
[BlockingMethod]
public Task Acquire(Task requestor)
{
	.
	.
	.
}
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Monitors</h2>
<p>
	Monitors serve as <em>observers</em> to the running simulation.  Each time a
	monitorable property changes, a <span class="classname">Monitor</span> class will record
	the new value and the time of the change.  Monitors can aggregate observations
	into summary statistics (like the Mean) or they can simply record each observation
	for use at a later time.
</p>
<p>
	Monitors that compute statistics are divided into two types: simple statisics
	and time-weighted statistics.  Simple statistics are not affected by the time
	between observations (e.g. the Maximum or Minimum), while time-weighted statistics
	use the time between observations to weight the observation (e.g. WeightedMean).
</p>


<h1><a name="shop"></a>Barber Shop Example</h1>

<p>
	This example simulates a small barber shop.  It uses three classes:
	one represents the shop; one a barber; and one a client or customer.
	It's operation is quite straightforeward:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		A single generator process creates a new customer (someone who
		wants a	haircut) about once every five minutes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Each customer enters the shop and attempts to acquire a barber
		resource.  If no barbers are available, the customer queues to
		wait for one.
	</li>
	<li>
		When a customer successfully acquires a barber, they activate
		the associated barber process to do the haircut.
	</li>
	<li>
		When the barber process finishes, the customer process is
		re-activated.  At this point, the customer pays for the haircut,
		releases the barber resource, and leaves the shop.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This code demonstrates using a <span class="classname">TrackedResource</span>
	that contains four <span class="classname">Process</span> instances.  Here, the
	tracked resource contains four <span class="classname">Barber</span> processes
	which are acquired by and service <span class="classname">Customer</span> processes.
</p>
<p>
	The source files for this example can be found in the
	<b>examples\BarberShop</b> directory.

<h2>The Shop</h2>

<p>
	Below is the complete code for the <span class="classname">Shop</span> class
	found in <tt>Shop.cs</tt>.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">

namespace BarberShop
{
    public class Shop : Simulation
    {
        private const long ClosingTime = 8 * 60;

        private Shop() {}

        private IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt; Generator(Process p, object data)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The barber shop is opening for business...");
            Resource barbers = CreateBarbers();

            Normal n = new Normal(5.0, 1.0);

            do
            {
                long d;
                do
                {
                    d = (long)n.NextDouble();
                } while (d &lt;= 0L);

                yield return p.Delay(d);

                Customer c = new Customer(this);
                c.Activate(null, 0L, barbers);

            } while (Now &lt; ClosingTime);

            Console.WriteLine("The barber shop is closed for the day.");

            if (barbers.BlockCount &gt; 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("The barbers have to work late today.");
            }

            yield break;
        }

        private Resource CreateBarbers()
        {
            Barber[] barbers = new Barber[4];
            barbers[0] = new Barber(this, "Frank");
            barbers[1] = new Barber(this, "Tom");
            barbers[2] = new Barber(this, "Bill");
            barbers[3] = new Barber(this, "Joe");

            return Resource.Create(barbers);
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Shop shop = new Shop();
            Task generator = new Process(shop, shop.Generator);
            shop.Run(generator);
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
	The <span class="classname">Shop</span> class is derived from the
	<span class="classname">Simulation</span> class and contains the <code>Main</code>
	method.  <code>Main</code> creates the <span class="classname">Shop</span>
	simulation instance and a single <em>generator</em> task.  In this case,
	the generator task &#8212; conveniently named <code>generator</code> &#8212;
	is a <span class="classname">Process</span> instance whose actual functionality is
	provided by a delegate &#8212; the method <code>Shop.Generator</code>.
	Finally, <code>Main</code> starts the simulation running with the call to
	<code>shop.Run(generator)</code>.
</p>
	
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Shop shop = new Shop();
    Task generator = new Process(shop, shop.Generator);
    shop.Run(generator);
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
	The <code>Generator</code> method is used to initialize the shop's
	resources (e.g. the barbers) and to generate customers.  A
	<span class="classname">Normal</span> distribution is used to create a new customer
	about once every five minutes (it's a very busy barber shop).
</p>
	
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
Console.WriteLine("The barber shop is opening for business...");
Resource barbers = CreateBarbers();
Normal n = new Normal(5.0, 1.0);</pre>
</div>

<p>
	The private method <code>CreateBarbers</code> is used to
	create and array of <span class="classname">Barber</span> processes named <em>Frank</em>,
	<em>Tom</em>, <em>Bill</em>, and <em>Joe</em>.  After creating and filling the
	<code>barbers</code> array, a <span class="classname">TrackedResource</span> is
	obtained by calling <code>Resource.Create(barbers)</code>.  The resource is
	returned to the caller (the <code>Generator</code> method).
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
private Resource CreateBarbers()
{
    Barber[] barbers = new Barber[4];
    barbers[0] = new Barber(this, "Frank");
    barbers[1] = new Barber(this, "Tom");
    barbers[2] = new Barber(this, "Bill");
    barbers[3] = new Barber(this, "Joe");
    return Resource.Create(barbers);
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
	This is a good time to briefly explain the two types of resources provided
	by React.NET: <em>anonymous</em> and <em>tracked</em>.  Anonymous resources,
	provided by the <span class="classname">AnonymousResource</span> class, represent
	pools of items using only counts (e.g. there are five "things" in the pool).
	Tracked resources, on the other hand, "track" actual .NET objects.  When
	a resource item is acquired from a tracked resource, the task that acquired
	the resource item gains access to the associated object.
</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="howtos.html">How-tos</a> page (<em>Resources &amp;

		<span class="classname">TrackedResource</span> classes.
	</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
	Returning to the <code>Generate</code> method, it is now
	possible to begin creating <span class="classname">Customer</span> instances.
	Customers are continually created and activated until
	closing time, which is defined as eight hours after the
	start of the simulation.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
do
{
    long d;
    do
    {
        d = (long)n.NextDouble();
    } while (d &lt;= 0L);

    yield return p.Delay(d);

    Customer c = new Customer(this);
    c.Activate(null, 0L, barbers);

} while (Now &lt; ClosingTime);</pre>
</div>

<p>
	Two things to note about the above code: (1) because
	a <span class="classname">Normal</span> distribution can have long tails,
	we loop until we get an acceptable value; (2) the
	resource containing the four <span class="classname">Barber</span> processes is
	passed to each customer as <em>activation data</em> &#8212; the third
	parameter in the call to <code>c.Activate(..., <em>barbers</em>)</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, once closing time is reached, a message is printed
	indicating that the shop has closed for the day.  In addition,
	we check if the barbers have to work late because there are
	still customers waiting (who arrived before closing time).
	The <code>yield break;</code> statement signifies the end of
	the generation process.  Once the generation process terminates,
	no more customers will be created.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
Console.WriteLine("The barber shop is closed for the day.");

if (barbers.BlockCount &gt; 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The barbers have to work late today.");
}

yield break;</pre>

<h2>The Customer</h2>

<p>
	Below is the complete code for the <span class="classname">Customer</span> class
	found in <tt>Customer.cs</tt>.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using React;

namespace BarberShop
{
    internal class Customer : Process
    {
        internal Customer(Simulation sim) : base(sim) {}

        protected override IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt; GetProcessSteps()
        {
            Resource barbers = (Resource)ActivationData;
            yield return barbers.Acquire(this);

            System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(barbers == Activator);
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(ActivationData != null);
            Barber barber = (Barber)ActivationData;

            WaitOnTask(barber);
            yield return Suspend();
            // HINT: The above two lines of code can be shortened to
            //          yield return barber;

            Console.WriteLine("Customer pays {0} for the haircut.", barber.Name);

            yield return barbers.Release(this);
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
	The <span class="classname">Customer</span> class is derived from the
	<span class="classname">Process</span> class.  The actions of the
	<span class="classname">Customer</span> are defined by overloading the
	<code>GetProcessSteps</code> method.
</p>

<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
protected override IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt; GetProcessSteps()
{
    Resource barbers = (Resource)ActivationData;
    yield return barbers.Acquire(this);

    System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(barbers == Activator);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(ActivationData != null);
    Barber barber = (Barber)ActivationData;

    WaitOnTask(barber);
    yield return Suspend();
    // HINT: The above two lines of code can be shortened to
    //          yield return barber;

    Console.WriteLine("Customer pays {0} for the haircut.", barber.Name);

    yield return barbers.Release(this);
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
	The <span class="classname">Customer</span> process begins by retrieving the
	<span class="classname">Resource</span>	containing the four
	<span class="classname">Barber</span> objects from the
	activation data.  It then attempts to acquire a
	<span class="classname">Barber</span> from the resource.
</p>

<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
Resource barbers = (Resource)ActivationData;
yield return barbers.Acquire(this);</pre>
</div>

<p>
	Upon re-activation, the <span class="classname">Customer</span> should now have acquired
	a <span class="classname">Barber</span>.  A few assertions double check to
	make sure.  Because we don't have to deal with interrupts,
	we know that <code>barbers</code> (i.e. the resource) should
	have been the object that re-activated the client.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">

	<p>
		The <code>ActivationData</code> property will often change with each activation
		of a <span class="classname">Process</span>.  The first time the
		<span class="classname">Customer</span> was activated, the <code>ActivationData</code>
		contained a reference to a <span class="classname">Resource</span>; on the second
		activation, <code>ActivationData</code> contained a reference to the
		<span class="classname">Barber</span> acquired from <code>barbers</code>.
	</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
	The <span class="classname">Customer</span> can now activate the acquired
	<span class="classname">Barber</span> to have his or her hair cut.  Note how one
	process gets served	by another process.  This is typical of a <em>multi-agent</em>
	simulation.  As the comment below indicates, the code can be shortened to a single
	line (<code>yield return barber;</code>).  The more verbose method is shown
	because it better illustrates exactly what the <span class="classname">Customer</span>
	is doing.
</p>

<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
WaitOnTask(barber);
yield return Suspend();

// HINT: The above two lines of code can be shortened to
//          yield return barber;</pre>
</div>

<p>
	Lastly, the <span class="classname">Client</span> must release the resource.
</p>
<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
yield return barbers.Release(this);</pre>
</div>

<h2>The Barber</h2>

	<p>
		Below is the complete code for the <span class="classname">Barber</span> class
		found in <tt>Barber.cs</tt>.
	</p>
	<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using React;

namespace BarberShop
{
    internal class Barber : Process
    {
        internal Barber(Simulation sim, string name) : base(sim)
        {
            this.Name = name;
        }

        protected override IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt; GetProcessSteps()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(Name + " begins cutting customer's hair ...");
            yield return Delay(22);
            Console.WriteLine(Name + " finishes cutting customer's hair.");
            yield break;
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
	
	<p>
		The <span class="classname">Barber</span> class, like the
		<span class="classname">Customer</span> class, is also a
		<span class="classname">Process</span>.  It's implementation of
		<code>GetProcessSteps</code> simply delays for twenty-two minutes
		to simulate the time it takes to cut the customers's hair.
	</p>
	<div class="example"><pre style="margin: 0px;">
protected override IEnumerator&lt;Task&gt; GetProcessSteps()
{
    Console.WriteLine(Name + " begins cutting client's hair ...");
    yield return Delay(22);
    Console.WriteLine(Name + " finishes cutting client's hair.");
    yield break;
}</pre>
</div>

	<p>
		Once the <span class="classname">Barber</span> process completes the
		<span class="classname">Customer</span> that is blocking on the
		<span class="classname">Barber</span> is automatically re-activated.
	</p>
