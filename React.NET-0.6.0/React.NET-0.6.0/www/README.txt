This directory contains the XML sources, CSS & XSLT stylesheets, and images
used to build the React.NET web pages.  Pre-generated versions of the pages,
suitable for local use, are located in the 'doc\html' directory.

Unless you really want to re-generate the web pages, you probably don't need
the contents of this directory.
